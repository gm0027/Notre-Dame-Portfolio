# Notre Dame Portfolio Challenge 

![Portfolio Analysis](Images/portfolio-analysis.png)

## Background
Attached is my simulated portfolio in an attempt to outperform the Vanguard Total Market Index Fund (VTI). I have attached my risk analysis, stock choices, and weights of each specific stock. The stocks that I have chosen are: 

- Microsoft (MSFT)
- Google (GOOG)
Automatic Data Processing (ADP)
Amazon (AMZN) 
The Blackstone Group (BX) 
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)
Shopify (SHOP) 

I have chosen the weight of each stock by assessing the Annualized Sharpe Ratio of each stock. In this hypothetical situation, I have chosen an initial investment of $100,000 and levered the Total Market Index based on my portfolio beta.
